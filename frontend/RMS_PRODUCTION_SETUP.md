# RMS Intelligence System - Production Setup Guide

## üö® IMPORTANT: Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure you have:

1. ‚úÖ Backed up your production database
2. ‚úÖ Tested all migrations locally
3. ‚úÖ Verified all environment variables are set in Vercel
4. ‚úÖ Reviewed all formulas and rules for production readiness

## üìã Environment Variables Required

Add these to your Vercel project settings:

```bash
# Existing variables (should already be set)
DATABASE_URL="your-supabase-connection-string"
DIRECT_URL="your-supabase-direct-connection-string"

# New RMS-specific variables
FORMULA_CACHE_TTL="60"              # Cache formulas for 60 seconds
ENABLE_FORMULA_SANDBOX="true"       # Enable formula testing
AUDIT_ALL_CALCULATIONS="true"       # Log all calculations
MAX_FORMULA_EXECUTION_TIME="5000"   # Max 5 seconds per formula
MAX_RULE_EXECUTION_TIME="3000"      # Max 3 seconds per rule
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies Locally
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Create Database Migration
```bash
# Generate migration for RMS tables
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_rms_intelligence_system
```

### 3. Commit All Changes
```bash
# Stage all RMS files
git add .

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "feat: Add RMS Intelligence System with dynamic formulas and rules

- Database-driven formula engine for pricing calculations
- Dynamic business rules with condition/action system
- Admin API for managing formulas, rules, and parameters
- Sandy AI integration for formula explanations
- Complete audit trail for all calculations
- Version control for formula changes"
```

### 4. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 5. Vercel Deployment (Automatic)
Vercel will automatically deploy when you push to main. Monitor the deployment:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Check the deployment logs
3. Verify the build completes successfully

### 6. Run Production Migrations
After deployment, run migrations on production:

```bash
# Option A: Using Vercel CLI
vercel env pull .env.production.local
npm run db:migrate

# Option B: Using Supabase Dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor and run the migration SQL manually
```

### 7. Seed Initial Data
```bash
# Load initial formulas and rules
NODE_ENV=production npm run db:seed:rms
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Test Formula API
```bash
# Test formula listing
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/admin/formulas \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ps_me2w0k3e_x81fsv0yz3k"

# Should return list of seeded formulas
```

### 2. Test ADR Calculation
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/rms/calculate/adr \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ps_me2w0k3e_x81fsv0yz3k" \
  -d '{
    "date": "2024-07-15",
    "roomType": "Ocean View",
    "occupancy": 85,
    "competitorRates": [180, 195, 210]
  }'
```

### 3. Test Sandy Integration
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/sandy/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ps_me2w0k3e_x81fsv0yz3k" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Explain the baseline ADR formula"
  }'
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Formula Performance**
   - Average execution time < 100ms
   - Error rate < 0.1%

2. **Rule Effectiveness**
   - Rules matching as expected
   - Actions completing successfully

3. **API Response Times**
   - Admin APIs < 1s
   - RMS calculations < 500ms
   - Sandy queries < 2s

### Database Queries to Monitor
```sql
-- Check recent calculations
SELECT 
  f.name as formula_name,
  COUNT(*) as calculation_count,
  AVG(c.execution_time) as avg_execution_time,
  MAX(c.execution_time) as max_execution_time
FROM "RMSCalculation" c
JOIN "RMSFormula" f ON c.formula_id = f.id
WHERE c.calculated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY f.name
ORDER BY calculation_count DESC;

-- Check rule execution
SELECT 
  r.name as rule_name,
  COUNT(*) as execution_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN e.condition_met THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as matches,
  AVG(e.execution_time) as avg_execution_time
FROM "RMSRuleExecution" e
JOIN "RMSRule" r ON e.rule_id = r.id
WHERE e.executed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY r.name;
```

## üö® Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback immediately:

```bash
# 1. Revert to previous deployment in Vercel
# Go to Vercel Dashboard > Deployments > Select previous > Promote to Production

# 2. If database issues, restore from backup
# Use Supabase point-in-time recovery

# 3. Disable RMS features via parameters
UPDATE "RMSFormula" SET is_active = false;
UPDATE "RMSRule" SET is_active = false;
```

## üìù Production Checklist

Before marking deployment complete:

- [ ] All API endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Formulas calculating without errors
- [ ] Rules evaluating as expected
- [ ] Sandy can explain formulas
- [ ] Audit trail recording calculations
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Error rates within acceptable limits

## üîê Security Notes

1. **API Keys**: Ensure production API keys are different from development
2. **Formula Validation**: All formulas are validated before execution
3. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor for abuse and adjust limits if needed
4. **Audit Logs**: Review logs daily for first week

## üìû Support

If issues arise:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Review Supabase logs
3. Check browser console for client-side errors
4. Contact support with deployment ID and error details

**Remember**: Always test in development first. The RMS system is critical for pricing - handle with care!
