## ðŸ“Š Current Data Status

### Database Contents
- **OccupancyData**: 96 records
- **PaceReport**: 432 records
- **RateShop**: 0 records (empty)

  - 18 Occupancy files
  - 33+ PaceReport files
  - 86+ RateShop files (none imported yet)

## ðŸš¨ Key Issues

1. **No Rate Shop Data**: The RateShop table is empty despite 86+ CSV files available
2. **Limited Data Coverage**: Only partial occupancy and pace data imported
3. **No New Uploads**: Sandy hasn't uploaded any new data files

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Import Rate Shop Data**: Process the 86+ rate shop CSV files to enable competitor analysis
2. **Complete Data Migration**: Import remaining occupancy and pace files
3. **Check with Sandy**: She's actively using the system - ask if she needs help uploading new data

### For Sandy's Next Steps
1. Sandy can upload new CSV files via the admin panel: `/admin`
2. The multi-agent system is working and responding to her queries
3. More data = better recommendations from the AI agents

## ðŸ“ˆ Usage Insights

Sandy is effectively using the multi-agent system:
- Testing all 6 specialized agents
- Asking relevant business questions
- Active both early morning and late morning

The system is responding but could provide better insights with:
- Complete rate shop data for competitive analysis
